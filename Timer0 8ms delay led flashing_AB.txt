 MicroController- Atmega32A
 Crystal -         16Mhz
 
 Code = Generate delay of 8ms using 8bit timer0 
        with using Timer0  and without Prescaller it takes 16us to complete TCNT register
        with using Prescaller of 1034 it require 16.384ms 
        but from that we only count unto 8ms so it takes 125 ticks 
        8ms / 0.064=125 ticks.
		
		blinking led per 8ms on port B0
		
		NOTE-Sorry Led may not see like blinking,It only see with constantly on . Its is very low delay to see led flashing .
		After nearly 17ms to 20 ms delay gap led will observe like flashing.
